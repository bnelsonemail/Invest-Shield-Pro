The goal of the MVP is to focus on core features, delivering a working product with the least amount of functionality needed to solve the main problem.

MVP Features Breakdown
	User Portfolio Input
	Real-time Portfolio Tracking
	Basic Risk Analysis
	Visualizations
	Rebalancing Suggestions (optional for MVP)


Outline for MVP Development
1. Set Up Project Structure
	Step 1.1: Create a new Python project folder.
		Folder structure might look like this:
			investment_tracker/
				├── data/
				├── src/
				├── tests/
				├── requirements.txt
				└── app.py

	Step 1.2: Initialize a virtualenv or use a venv to manage dependencies.
	Step 1.3: Create a requirements.txt file and install necessary libraries such as:
		pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance, flask (if building a web interface), plotly (optional).
2. User Portfolio Input
	Step 2.1: Design a simple way to input portfolios.
		For MVP, use a command-line interface or CSV upload for input.
		Collect the following information:
		Asset (e.g., stock ticker like 'AAPL', 'BTC-USD')
		Quantity
		Purchase date (optional for basic functionality)
	Step 2.2: Store inputted data in a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

import pandas as pd

# Example input
portfolio = {
    'Asset': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'BTC-USD'],
    'Quantity': [10, 5, 0.1]
}

df_portfolio = pd.DataFrame(portfolio)
print(df_portfolio)


3. Real-time Portfolio Tracking
	Step 3.1: Fetch current price data for assets in the portfolio.
		Use the yfinance library to pull historical and real-time data.
	Step 3.2: Write a function to fetch the latest price of assets and calculate the current value of the portfolio.

import yfinance as yf

def fetch_data(ticker):
    data = yf.download(ticker, period='1d', interval='1d')
    return data['Close'].iloc[0]

def calculate_portfolio_value(df):
    total_value = 0
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        price = fetch_data(row['Asset'])
        total_value += price * row['Quantity']
    return total_value

portfolio_value = calculate_portfolio_value(df_portfolio)
print(f"Current Portfolio Value: ${portfolio_value:.2f}")


4. Basic Risk Analysis
	Step 4.1: Implement basic risk and return calculations.
		For each asset, calculate:
		Expected return (average log returns over time).
		Volatility (standard deviation of returns).
	Step 4.2: Use historical price data from yfinance to perform these calculations.

def calculate_expected_return(ticker):
    data = yf.download(ticker, period='1y', interval='1d')
    log_returns = np.log(data['Close'] / data['Close'].shift(1))
    return log_returns.mean() * 252  # Annualized expected return

def calculate_volatility(ticker):
    data = yf.download(ticker, period='1y', interval='1d')
    log_returns = np.log(data['Close'] / data['Close'].shift(1))
    return log_returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized volatility

	Step 4.3: Output simple risk metrics like the Sharpe ratio to give the user an idea of risk-adjusted returns.


5. Visualizations
	Step 5.1: Add basic visualizations using matplotlib or plotly.
		Portfolio Allocation Pie Chart: Show how much of the portfolio is in each asset class.
		Performance Over Time: Show the historical performance of each asset.
	Step 5.2: Plot the portfolio value over time by aggregating the value of each asset.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_pie_chart(df):
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.pie(df['Quantity'], labels=df['Asset'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
    plt.title('Portfolio Allocation')
    plt.show()


6. Rebalancing Suggestions (Optional)
	Step 6.1: Set a risk tolerance threshold (e.g., based on standard deviation).
	Step 6.2: Based on the user's risk tolerance, suggest rebalancing by adjusting the allocation in riskier or less risky assets.
	Step 6.3: Keep the suggestions simple for MVP, such as recommending selling assets that contribute too much volatility to the portfolio and increasing holdings in lower-risk assets.
Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)
	User Profiles: Store user portfolios and preferences in a database.
	Historical Portfolio Performance Tracking: Keep track of past performance.
	Advanced Metrics: Add advanced calculations such as Monte Carlo simulations, Value at Risk (VaR), or covariance matrix between assets.
	Web Interface: Migrate the CLI to a simple web-based interface using Flask.
	Notifications: Set up email or SMS alerts for when portfolio risk exceeds certain levels.

Final Project Flow
	User Input: Collect user portfolio data via command line or CSV.
	Fetch Data: Use the yfinance API to get the latest and historical asset prices.
	Portfolio Value: Calculate the current portfolio value based on asset quantities.
	Risk/Return Metrics: Calculate expected return, volatility, and other risk metrics.
	Visualization: Generate simple visualizations like pie charts for allocation and line charts for historical performance.
	Rebalancing (Optional): Provide basic suggestions for rebalancing the portfolio based on risk.
